  ///  * [secondaryAnimation]: The animation for the route being pushed on top of
  ///    this route. This animation lets this route coordinate with the entrance
  ///    and exit transition of routes pushed on top of this route.
  ///
  /// This method is only called when the route is first built, and rarely

  /// the route; this will cause the widget to be rebuilt each time the route
  /// changes state.
  ///
  /// In general, [buildPage] should be used to build the page contents, and
  /// [buildTransitions] for the widgets that change as the page is brought in
  /// and out of view. Avoid using [buildTransitions] for content that never
  /// changes; building such content once from [buildPage] is more efficient.

  /// widgets that define how the route arrives on and leaves the screen.
  ///
  /// By default, the child (which contains the widget returned by [buildPage])
  /// is not wrapped in any transition widgets.
  ///
  /// The [buildTransitions] method, in contrast to [buildPage], is called each
  /// time the [Route]'s state changes (e.g. the value of [canPop]).
  ///
  /// The [buildTransitions] method is typically used to define transitions
  /// that animate the new topmost route's comings and goings. When the

  /// topmost route, e.g. because the use pressed the back button, the
  /// primary animation runs from 1.0 to 0.0.

  /// The following example uses the primary animation to drive a
  /// [SlideTransition] that translates the top of the new route vertically
  /// from the bottom of the screen when it is pushed on the Navigator's
  /// stack. When the route is popped the SlideTransition translates the

  ///
  /// We've used [PageRouteBuilder] to demonstrate the [buildTransitions] method
  /// here. The body of an override of the [buildTransitions] method would be
  /// defined in the same way.
  ///
  /// When the [Navigator] pushes a route on the top of its stack, the
  /// [secondaryAnimation] can be used to define how the route that was on
  /// the top of the stack leaves the screen. Similarly when the topmost route
  /// is popped, the secondaryAnimation can be used to define how the route
  /// below it reappears on the screen. When the Navigator pushes a new route
  /// on the top of its stack, the old topmost route's secondaryAnimation
  /// runs from 0.0 to 1.0. When the Navigator pops the topmost route, the
  /// secondaryAnimation for the route below it runs from 1.0 to 0.0.

  /// The example below adds a transition that's driven by the

  /// this callback:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  ///   return WillPopScope(
  ///     onWillPop: askTheUserIfTheyAreSure,
  ///     child: ...,
  ///   );
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This callback runs asynchronously and it's possible that it will be called
  /// after its route has been disposed. The callback should check [State.mounted]
  /// before doing anything.
  ///
  /// A typical application of this callback would be to warn the user about
  /// unsaved [Form] data if the user attempts to back out of the form. In that
  /// case, use the [Form.onWillPop] property to register the callback.
  ///
  /// To register a callback manually, look up the enclosing [ModalRoute] in a
  /// [State.didChangeDependencies] callback:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// ModalRoute<dynamic> _route;
  ///
  /// @override
  /// void didChangeDependencies() {
  ///  super.didChangeDependencies();
  ///  _route?.removeScopedWillPopCallback(askTheUserIfTheyAreSure);
  ///  _route = ModalRoute.of(context);
  ///  _route?.addScopedWillPopCallback(askTheUserIfTheyAreSure);
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// If you register a callback manually, be sure to remove the callback with
  /// [removeScopedWillPopCallback] by the time the widget has been disposed. A
  /// stateful widget can do this in its dispose method (continuing the previous
  /// example):
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// void dispose() {
  ///   _route?.removeScopedWillPopCallback(askTheUserIfTheyAreSure);
  ///   _route = null;
  ///   super.dispose();
  /// }

  ///  * [WillPopScope], which manages the registration and unregistration
  ///    process automatically.
  ///  * [Form], which provides an `onWillPop` callback that uses this mechanism.
  ///  * [willPop], which runs the callbacks added with this method.
